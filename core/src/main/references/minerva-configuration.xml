		Each Minerva environment will configure its own manager, defining the implementation classname.
		This XML element, including all its content is passed to the defined class so it will read 
			the inner elements according to its need. From this point on, the configuration is specific
			per implementation.
		
		Although not enforced in code, the following tags should be used AS-IS to standarize the basics 
			of a Minerva Manager implementation configuration.
	-->	
	<manager class="...">
		<!--
			Allows a set of properties, to be handled and used by the Manager implementation. This can be
				name-value pairs or more complex structures.
		-->
		<configuration/>
		<!--
			Defines the Report Factory implementation to be used. The configuration sub-tag will be passed
				to a newly created instance of the factory class, so it will be able to configure itself.
		-->
		<factory class="...">
			<!--
				Any configuration information needed by this implementation of the Report Factory interface.
